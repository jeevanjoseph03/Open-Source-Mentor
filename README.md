# Open Source Mentor

Open Source Mentor is a tiny web app that integrates with the GitHub REST API to help new developers contribute to open source.

## 🚀 What it does  
- Enter any GitHub username.  
- The app analyses the user’s starred repositories to find their most-used language.  
- It then surfaces a curated list of open “good first issues” from across GitHub in that language.  

## 💡 Why  
Finding the right first issue to work on can be hard for beginners. Open Source Mentor lowers the barrier for first-time contributors by recommending beginner-friendly issues tailored to their interests.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript  
- GitHub REST API
